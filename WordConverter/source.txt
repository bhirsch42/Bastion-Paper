When Mr Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly<br>be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of<br>special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in<br>Hobbiton. Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been<br>the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable<br>disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought<br>back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was<br>popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the<br>Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure.<p>You're only obeying your own body which says Hold still for awhile,<br>raging man. Hour after hour, for thirty years, you have shouldered up<br>a world towards your mind, seen it thrown down more than once as<br>though for ever, and righted it, lifted it, borne it even higher. It<br>would have broken twelve men's hearts, to have hewn their way through<br>these years as you have. The severe day begs for a little night to<br>rest in. Only a bruised, not a conquered King.
